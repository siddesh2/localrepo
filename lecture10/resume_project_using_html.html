                I created an AI system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for swift detection of suspicious activities in real-time
surveillance videos. The system employs computer vision to analyze and identify anomalies, triggering instant alerts for timely
intervention.Machine Learning Models for Trained models for behavioral analysis.

                <summary>1. What is the difference between client-side and server-side programming?</summary>
                
                Client-side programming involves writing code that runs on the user's browser and is responsible for user interface interactions, while server-side programming deals with code executed on a web server. This code typically processes requests, communicates with databases, and generates dynamic content 
                for websites.

                <summary>2. What is the use of HTTP cookies?</summary>
                
                HTTP cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored in the user's browser. They're used to maintain user-specific information, such as login session identifiers, user preferences, 
                and tracking user activity..

                <summary>3. Explain the concept of responsive web design</summary>
                
                Responsive web design is a method of designing websites to provide a consistent user experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes. This approach involves using flexible layouts, fluid grids, and CSS media queries to adapt the layout and appearance of a website based on the user's 
                device and screen resolution.

                <summary>4. What is a content delivery network (CDN)?</summary>
                
                A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed system of servers strategically placed across the globe to deliver web content (e.g., HTML, images, videos) to users more quickly and efficiently. CDNs minimize delays in loading web page content by caching and delivering it from the server 
                geographically closest to the user.
